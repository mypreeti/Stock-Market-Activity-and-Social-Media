Stock Market Activity and Its Relationship with Social Media

Title: Unraveling the Social Media Stock Market Nexus: Exploring the Influence of Reddit and Twitter on Tesla, Apple, and Zoom

In the ever-evolving landscape of financial markets, the intersection of social media and stock prices has become increasingly pronounced. A recent tweet by Elon Musk, the maverick billionaire and CEO of Tesla Motors, merely captioned "Gamestonk!!" alongside a link to a Reddit thread on WallStreetBets, sent shockwaves through the market, notably driving up the valuation of GameStop. This event underscored the potential influence of social media discourse on stock movements, prompting a deeper inquiry into its dynamics.

Motivated by this phenomenon, our research embarked on a quest to dissect the relationship between social media chatter and stock performance, focusing on three tech giants: Apple, Tesla, and Zoom. Our investigation spanned from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, harnessing the power of web scraping to gather mentions of these stocks across Reddit and Twitter. Our objective was clear: to discern whether the frequency of discussions on these platforms correlated with fluctuations in stock prices.

The preliminary findings of my study unveiled a nuanced correlation between the volume of Reddit and Twitter posts and the average weekly closing prices of TSLA, AAPL, and ZM. However, it is crucial to note that while this correlation leaned toward the positive spectrum, its magnitude varied from weak to moderate. 

Despite the intriguing connections unearthed, our analysis encountered a formidable hurdle in constructing predictive models: the lack of homoscedasticity within the dataset. This statistical concept, which pertains to the equal variance of data points, posed a significant challenge in crafting robust predictive frameworks.

While our findings shed light on the influence of social media on stock prices, they also underscore the complexity of predicting market movements solely based on online discourse. As we navigate this dynamic interplay between social media dynamics and financial markets, further exploration is needed to understand its implications fully.
